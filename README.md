# customer support performance dashboard

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer support operations to understand ticket workload, efficiency, and customer satisfaction.
A dataset of 17,000 support tickets was generated using Python (Faker library) to simulate a real-world helpdesk environment.
Using Power BI dashboards, we converted raw data into meaningful business insights.

#  Objectives
